 <h1>MY JOURNEY TO BEING A WEB DEVELOPER</h1>
 <h2>HOW IT BEGAN</h2>
  <p class="detail">What made me delve into the world of web development and design started when i was at a young age. The first time i saw a web page was on my sisters laptop, She was conducting a research on schools that offered the program she intented on studying.I was fascinated by the display of images on the website which I didnâ€™t fail to tell my friends about in school.
 Driven by curiosity at a young age I wanted to display images of myself and my family as it appeared on the web page.<p/>

<h2>HOW FREECODECAMP HELPED</h2>
<img src="freecodecamp.webp">
<p class="detail">My web development journey began with freecodecamp. I was struggling with learning html and css from other learning sites, but with help of freecodecamp, learning the programming languages became easier. This was because the learning modules provided an easier and more practical method of understanding html and css (which were among the first web programming languages i learnt). My journey with FreeCodeCamp has enabled me code with ease, comprehend more challenging coding problems and has given me greater interest in coding. To put into practice what i've learnt from FreeCodeCamp, i usually visit popular webpages and try to recreate them without any assistance.</p>
